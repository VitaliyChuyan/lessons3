        We run along a beautiful route that covers a picturesque lake and
        historic streets of charming Ivano-Frankivsk. The harmonious alternation
        of nature and the stone jungle of our route will contribute to a very
        close acquaintance with the city. The pleasant freshness of the lake and
        the coziness of the center will leave only positive feedback in your
        soul. A simple route of two laps will allow you to show yourself in all
        your running glory and improve your time, and possibly set a personal
        best.
